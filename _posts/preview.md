9TC is back and this time we are bringing the 1990s onchain! We have been celebrating the best decade ever for a while now and we are so glad to be back.  This time however we are bridging the gap between 1993 and Web3

## What To Expect With 9TC

We will still be talking about all things 90s in our four main topics: music, movies, tv and tech.  However we will be bringing more onchain elements into the mix(tape) to make sure we can preserve the 90s forever.
